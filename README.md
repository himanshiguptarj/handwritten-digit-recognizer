# 8 x 8 pixels image handwritten digit recognizer  

Handwritten digit recognition (HDR) is considered one of trivial and critical machine learning problems. It has been used widely by researchers as experiments for theories of machine learning algorithms for many years.

Here, we have 

• Built a digit recognizer based on MNIST digits dataset recognizing handwritten digits from 0 to 9 in 8 x 8 pixel images.
• Finalized machine learning model was a CNN based model with train accuracy 99.6% and test accuracy 97.2%.

### About dataset
The MNIST database is a large collection of handwritten digits. It has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. 

Create input folder and put test.csv and train.csv into it.
Then run this notebook to get desired result
